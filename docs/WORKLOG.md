# Worklog

Session journal for the refactor. **Newest entry on top.** Every working session appends one entry at the end of the session — this is how the next session (human or LLM) picks up where you left off.

## Entry template

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line session focus>
**Phase:** <masterplan phase(s) touched>
**Done:** <what shipped, with commit hashes; reference masterplan items ticked>
**Verified:** <how it was verified — build, manual flow, tests>
**Next:** <the exact next action, specific enough to start cold>
**Gotchas:** <surprises, decisions made, anything the next session must know — omit if none>
```

Rules: keep entries under ~20 lines; don't duplicate what the masterplan or git history already says; "Next" must be actionable without reading this whole file. Never rewrite old entries.

## 2026-07-08 — Planning session (no code changes)
**Phase:** pre-work
**Done:** Audited the codebase, Vercel, and DNS. Wrote `docs/MASTERPLAN.md` (8 phases), `AGENTS.md` (+ `CLAUDE.md` symlink), `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` (legacy format zoo with examples, canonical schema, transition rules — required reading before the migration), and this worklog. Created the `refactor` branch. Ran a full crosscheck pass over all docs: fixed a wrong Phase 6 claim (per-page metadata already exists), corrected the count-query claim (`getTotalAppointmentCount` already uses aggregation), resolved TS-timing and migration-sequencing contradictions (new code is TS from Phase 1; DB migration is additive dual-field until Phase 3), and defined the hotfix branch flow.
**Verified:** claims re-checked against code (line-level); docs mutually consistent as of this entry.
**Next:** the 🚨 HOTFIX (masterplan Phase 0, first item): validate `/api/send` + `/api/cancel` bodies. **Branch off `main`** as `hotfix/email-validation`, PR to `main` (NOT via refactor branch), then merge `main` back into `refactor`. See the hotfix item for exact requirements.
**Gotchas:** Production bug is live (customers silently missing confirmation emails since Feb). Firestore read-cost mindfulness is a hard rule — see AGENTS.md rule 2. The legacy `useX` hook family is dead code (verified unimported) — don't study it to understand the app.
